This is the Task Management Board web application!

The task board is a simple web application that allows you to manage your tasks.
I use nextjs for the frontend, and for the design, I use shadcn/ui for UI components, and tailwindcss for styling.
and for the state management I use zustand. I also use tanstack table for the table.
I used an alternative approach to the task board, and used dropdown to change the status of the task, and also used
filtering to filter the tasks by title, priority, status and created at.
please take note that the tasks added to the board is not persisted. Once the page is refreshed,
the added tasks will be lost.
